# Workday / Shift Control Playbook

## Current Purpose

The workday module is being prepared for a small pilot. The goal is reliable
daily control, not adding many manual checklist tasks.

## Important Files

## Shift Rules

Supported shift-control shifts:

```text
retail:    09_18, 11_20, 09_20
wholesale: 09_18, 09_19, 10_19
```

Unsupported shifts for retail/wholesale should not create empty
`ShiftControlRun` records. If no active template exists, show a clear employee
error instead of creating a run without tasks.

## Templates

Production has active templates for:

```text
retail / 09_18
retail / 11_20
retail / 09_20
wholesale / 09_18
wholesale / 09_19
wholesale / 10_19
```

`retail / 09_20` was added for long retail days.

## Photos And Cash

1C cash statement data is now available through AIAgentAPI and shown in admin
workday. This reduces the need for employees to photograph 1C statements.

Business direction:

- employees should confirm real-world cash recounts;
- admins can compare with 1C cash statement balances;
- do not show 1C expected cash too prominently to employees if it encourages
  copying instead of recounting;
- photos should be required only when they are useful evidence.

Do not turn the employee checklist into a second 1C. The employee should confirm
real-world control and report discrepancies; the portal/admin side can compare
against 1C where available.

## Stale Unfinished Workday

Employees can have an unfinished previous workday. The UI was adjusted so a
stale day can be closed with a reason/comment instead of forcing impossible
handover steps later.

Future improvements may include explicit violation status, admin approval and
discipline impact, but do not add those unless requested.

## Upload Safety

Photos live under `/app/uploads` and must survive rebuild/restart through Docker
volume `portal-uploads`.

## Pilot Priority

Before expanding features, make sure:

- no empty shift runs can be created;
- supported shifts are clear;
- stale previous day can be handled;
- admin can see who started, finished, missed schedule and has shift-control
  issues;
- uploads persist across deploy.

## Before Changing Workday

Ask:

- Can the employee complete the happy path on mobile?
- Can a stale previous day be closed without impossible proof steps?
- Could this create an empty `ShiftControlRun`?
- Does this require a migration or only UI/API logic?
- Will admins see enough context to understand the exception?
- Are uploaded photos still stored in the Docker volume after deploy?

If adding reminders, prefer push notifications for checklist timing; Telegram is
not the preferred first channel for this pilot.
